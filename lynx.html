			<p class="interesting">Although they closely resemble the bobcat, the Lynx's tail is completley black-tipped,
				while the bobcat's tail has a white ring below the black tip. </p>

			<p>The Lynx is a very solitary and mysterious animal. You can track a Lynx for a month and never see it. 
				The Lynx has a wide face with fluffy patches that make the Lynx appear bearded. 
				The Lynx is more than twice the size of a house cat. They are excellent night hunters and prefer to
				hunt the snowshoe hare.
